HD Pocket Radio Manual
======================

To use this addon, extract the contents of this .pk3
and copy your music files into "/music", and rename them 
to "rdiochXY", where XY is the number of the channel you 
want to use to play that track. Then just repack the files. 

You may also place the music in a separate archive and
load it with RTIP if you plan on making multiple playlists.

"radioch9"  -  music for ch. 9
"radioch10" -  music for ch. 10
..
"radioch99" -  music for ch. 99
