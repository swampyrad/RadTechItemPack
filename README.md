# Radtech Item Pack

A collection of various items for [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor). Includes various medical items, wearables and more.

## Field-Medic Kit

* **Actor Class**: `HDFieldMedicKit`
* **Loadout Code**: `fmd`
  * An emergency medical kit that contains rolls of medical gauze, tape, scissors and more to help speed up the bandaging process of bleeding wounds. A bit more sanitary and safe, though that usually doesn't cross many soldier's minds when they need to use one.

## Leather Armour

* **Actor Class**: `HDLeatherArmour`
* **Loadout Code**: `awl | arl`
  * Mostly known nowadays as the "Poor Mans Garrison Armour", many scavengers and civilians will create and wear these as a replacement for proper armor until they find some. Due to usually being weaved with Kevlar, this bit of leather armour will still save your life from a couple pistol shots, though higher rounds or dangers will still get through.
